Hey guys,

I have a minor concussion and I won't be able to
work on this project until Monday at the earliest.
I updated all of the files on github to the most
recent version I have. I asked Mr Hoel for an
extension but I̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶k̶n̶o̶w̶ ̶i̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶.̶

It didn't work. He said "The good news is that 
you have other members of the group who you can
help by talking them through the work. This is
a major benefit of groups, they have redundant
parts and can adapt :-)"

You can try asking if you think you need one
and that he might give it to you. If you need
help during class you can call me at
647-967-5251. I'm not supposed to look at screens.

Please make sure to delete your database and replace
it with the one I left in database.txt using the
import thing on phpmyadmin. The website won't work
if you dont do this.

Good Luck,

Zack
