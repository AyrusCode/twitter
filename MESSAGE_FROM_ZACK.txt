Hey guys,

I have a minor concussion and I won't be able to
work on this project until Monday at the earliest.
I updated all of the files on github to the most
recent version I have. I asked Mr Hoel for an
extension but I don't know if that will work.

Please make sure to delete your database and replace
it with the one I left in database.txt using the
import thing on phpmyadmin. The website won't work
if you dont do this.

Good Luck,

Zack
