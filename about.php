                    <h2>About</h2>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Enlighten is a project we have been working on in our Grade 10 computer science class.
                        We started off with a table and a database and edit the sample code until we could
                        add "tweets", add/search hashtags, and search users. etc. Tools used were IDEs such as Atom and Adobe
                        Dreamweaver CS6. In terms of programming languages used, we used CSS, HTML, and PHP to do all of our
                        editing/programming.
                    </p>
