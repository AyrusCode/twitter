#Enlighten!

##About
Enlighten is a project we have been working on in our Grade 10 computer science class. We started off with a sample project where we could add and remove rows from an SQL database. We edited the sample code until we could add "tweets" and search for hashtags and users. We also created a beautiful website to go with it. 

The website uses HTML5 and CSS for the frontend, and PHP and SQL for the backend. Bootstrap, StackOverFlow, W3Schools, Github, and Google were all extremely helpful resources and we could not have made this website without them. 

The programming was all done in two IDEs, Atom and Adobe Dreamweaver CS6. Each developer used the IDE of their choice. MAMP was used to manage the website and run the MySQL and Apache servers. Enlighten was made with and optimized for Google Chrome. 

Creating this website was an excellent and enjoyable learning experience for all of the developers. We started with little to no knowledge of any of the tools or languages involved. Now all of us have the necessary skills to create and manage our own websites.


##FAQ and Help
######Why are there no tweets? 

Because you just downloaded an empty version of the website! With the release, we provided an SQL database import script with a sample database of tweets and users for you to use. 

######Can I search for a user and a hashtag at the same time? 

Yes, you absolutely can! Just type each search term into the correct box and click the GO! button on either one of them. Any new search will automatically clear the old search. 

######Where did you find these beautiful backgrounds? 

These backgrounds are all screenshots from a game called Firewatch. If you are interested, The game is available on steam, and you can visit their website at www.firewatchgame.com 

######I love the website so much! Can I hire you guys?
